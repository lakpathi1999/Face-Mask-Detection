# Face-Mask-Detection
Developed a deep learning model for face mask detection using Python, Keras, and OpenCV. Developed the face mask detector model for detecting whether person is wearing a mask or not. Trained the model using Keras with CNN. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCv is the second part.
